# A Future-Adaptable Password Scheme
In this repo i am trying to implement `eksblowfish`, `block cipher` and `bcrypt` as mentioned in Niels Provos and David Mazi√®res (1999) to understand how hashing algorithms work in general under the hood.

## Salt
Salt is random data fed as an additional input to the one-way function hat hashes the password. The salt and the password are concatenated and processed through the Blowfish.
